# ProjectJuniper
Assessing product launch for a food delivery app.

This project was part the end result of a sprint I did with Skillful (https://www.jointhecommons.co/sprints/core)
The data is from an app launch of a fictional quick-commerce food delivery marketplace named Juniper.

The goal was to present the current status of the launch, whats working, and specific improvements for what isn't working.

Tools Used:
SQL - to dig through datasets
Tableau - to visualize them
Google Sheets - to present our insights
